        "title": "Fluid Mosaic Model",
        "content": "The cell membrane is described by the fluid mosaic model, consisting of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates. This structure creates selective permeability, allowing some substances to pass freely while restricting others. The membrane is dynamic, with components constantly moving and interacting."
