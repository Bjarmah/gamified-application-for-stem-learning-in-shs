      "introduction": "Linear equations are the foundation of algebra and essential for solving real-world problems. A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = c, where a, b, and c are constants and x is the variable. Understanding how to manipulate and solve these equations is crucial for advanced mathematical concepts.",

Examples include:\n\n• 2x + 5 = 11\n• 3x - 7 = 14\n• x/4 + 2 = 6\n\nThese equations represent straight lines when graphed, hence the term 'linear'. The goal is to find the value of the variable that makes the equation true."
