Good **sampling** (random, stratified, systematic) reduces bias and improves validity. Data are presented using **tables**, **bar charts**, **pie charts**, **histograms**, and **line graphs**. In Ghana, sources include the **Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)** and school surveys. Accurate presentation helps reveal trends in population, agriculture yield, or market prices. Choosing the right chart depends on the data type and the message you want to convey.",
