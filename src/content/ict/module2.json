          "title": "Network Fundamentals",
          "content": "Computer networks connect devices to share resources and information. Network types include Local Area Networks (LANs) for small areas like homes or schools, and Wide Area Networks (WANs) that connect larger geographical areas. Network topology describes how devices are arranged, while protocols are rules that govern data transmission. The OSI model provides a framework for understanding network communication layers."

          "title": "Internet Services and Applications",
          "content": "The internet offers various services including web browsing, email communication, social media platforms, and e-commerce. Web browsers access websites using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Email systems use SMTP for sending and POP/IMAP for receiving messages. Social media platforms enable global communication and content sharing. E-commerce allows online buying and selling, transforming business practices worldwide."

          "title": "Network Security and Safety",
          "content": "Cybersecurity protects networks and devices from threats like malware, phishing, and unauthorized access. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and regular software updates are essential security practices. Safe browsing habits include avoiding suspicious links, using secure websites (HTTPS), and being cautious with personal information. Understanding these practices helps protect against online threats."
