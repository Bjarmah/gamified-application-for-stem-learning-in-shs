      "title": "Photosynthesis Process",
      "text": "Photosynthesis occurs in **chloroplasts** and has two stages: **light reactions** and the **Calvin cycle**. In the thylakoid membranes, light energy excites electrons in **chlorophyll**, splitting water (photolysis) to release **O2**, producing **ATP** and **NADPH**. In the stroma, the Calvin cycle uses CO2, ATP, and NADPH to produce **glucose** through carbon fixation (RuBisCO), reduction, and regeneration of RuBP. Rates depend on **light intensity**, **CO2 concentration**, **temperature**, and water availability.\n\nFor Ghanaian crops like maize and cocoa, optimizing shade, spacing, and irrigation improves photosynthetic efficiency and yield. Understanding limiting factors helps farmers decide when to provide shade nets or irrigation during the dry season.",
