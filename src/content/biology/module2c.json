      "text": "**Photosynthesis** and **cellular respiration** are complementary processes that form the foundation of energy flow in living systems.\n\n**Photosynthesis** (energy storage):\n- **Location:** Chloroplasts in plants\n- **Inputs:** 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy\n- **Outputs:** C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n- **Function:** Converts light energy to chemical energy (glucose)\n\n**Cellular Respiration** (energy release):\n- **Location:** Mitochondria in all organisms\n- **Inputs:** C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n- **Outputs:** 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ~30ATP\n- **Function:** Releases stored chemical energy for cellular work\n\n**Key relationships:**\n- Products of one process are reactants of the other\n- Both involve electron transport chains and chemiosmosis\n- Photosynthesis builds organic molecules; respiration breaks them down\n- Plants do both processes; animals only respire\n\nIn Ghana's agricultural cycle, **maize** plants use photosynthesis during the growing season to store energy in kernels, which humans and livestock later access through cellular respiration when consuming the grain.",
