      "text": "Two organelles are crucial for energy conversion in cells: **mitochondria** and **chloroplasts**.\n\n**Mitochondria** are the powerhouses of all eukaryotic cells. They have a double membrane structure with folded inner membranes called **cristae** that increase surface area. Through **cellular respiration**, mitochondria convert glucose and oxygen into **ATP** (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency. The process involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.\n\n**Chloroplasts** are found only in plant cells and some algae. They contain **chlorophyll** and other pigments that capture light energy for **photosynthesis**. Chloroplasts have **thylakoids** arranged in stacks called **grana**, where light reactions occur, and a **stroma** where carbon fixation happens.\n\nIn Ghana's agricultural systems, understanding these organelles explains how **cocoa** plants convert sunlight into sugar (chloroplasts) and how all plant and animal cells use that energy for growth and metabolism (mitochondria). Healthy mitochondria are essential for muscle function in farm animals and humans working in agriculture.",

      "text": "The **endomembrane system** processes and transports proteins throughout the cell. This system includes the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**, **Golgi apparatus**, and various **vesicles**.\n\n**Rough ER** has ribosomes attached to its surface and modifies proteins destined for secretion or membrane insertion. **Smooth ER** lacks ribosomes and synthesizes lipids, metabolizes carbohydrates, and detoxifies substances.\n\nThe **Golgi apparatus** receives proteins from the ER in vesicles, modifies them further (adding carbohydrate groups), packages them, and ships them to their final destinations via vesicles.\n\n**Lysosomes** are membrane-bound organelles containing digestive enzymes that break down waste materials, worn-out organelles, and harmful substances. **Peroxisomes** detoxify harmful compounds and break down fatty acids.\n\nIn Ghana's food processing industry, understanding these systems helps explain how cells in **palm oil** production process and package oils, and how digestive cells in the human gut process traditional foods like **fufu** and **groundnut soup**.",
