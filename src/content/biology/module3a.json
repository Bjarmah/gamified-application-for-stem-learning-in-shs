      "text": "The **heart** is a four-chambered muscular pump that maintains blood circulation. It has two **atria** (receiving chambers) and two **ventricles** (pumping chambers).\n\n**Heart chambers:**\n- **Right atrium:** Receives deoxygenated blood from body\n- **Right ventricle:** Pumps blood to lungs\n- **Left atrium:** Receives oxygenated blood from lungs\n- **Left ventricle:** Pumps blood to body (thickest wall)\n\n**Heart valves prevent backflow:**\n- **Tricuspid valve:** Between right atrium and ventricle\n- **Pulmonary valve:** Between right ventricle and pulmonary artery\n- **Bicuspid (mitral) valve:** Between left atrium and ventricle\n- **Aortic valve:** Between left ventricle and aorta\n\n**Cardiac cycle:**\n1. **Diastole:** Heart relaxes, chambers fill with blood\n2. **Systole:** Heart contracts, pumps blood out\n3. **Heart rate:** ~70 beats/minute at rest\n\nIn Ghana's rural communities, understanding heart function helps explain why regular physical activity (like farming work) strengthens the heart muscle and improves cardiovascular health, while sedentary lifestyles in urban areas increase heart disease risk.",
