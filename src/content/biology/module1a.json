      "text": "The cell membrane is a thin, flexible boundary that surrounds every cell. It consists of a **phospholipid bilayer** - two layers of phospholipid molecules arranged with their hydrophobic tails facing inward and hydrophilic heads facing outward. This creates a selectively permeable barrier.\n\nEmbedded within this bilayer are various **proteins** that serve different functions: channel proteins create pathways for specific molecules, carrier proteins bind and transport substances, and receptor proteins detect chemical signals. **Cholesterol** molecules help maintain membrane fluidity, while **carbohydrate** chains attached to proteins and lipids form the glycocalyx for cell recognition.\n\nIn Ghanaian agriculture, understanding membrane structure helps explain how plant cells in **cassava** and **plantain** maintain their shape and respond to environmental changes like drought or flooding.",
