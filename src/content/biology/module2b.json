      "text": "**Glycolysis** is the first stage of cellular respiration, occurring in the **cytoplasm** of all cells. It breaks down glucose (6-carbon) into two **pyruvate** molecules (3-carbon each).\n\n**Key steps:**\n1. **Energy investment phase:** Uses 2 ATP to activate glucose\n2. **Energy harvesting phase:** Produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH\n3. **Net gain:** 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 pyruvate\n\n**Overall equation:** C₆H₁₂O₆ + 2NAD⁺ + 2ADP + 2Pi → 2C₃H₄O₃ + 2NADH + 2H⁺ + 2ATP\n\nGlycolysis doesn't require oxygen, making it crucial during intense exercise when oxygen delivery to muscles is limited. The **NADH** produced must be regenerated to **NAD⁺** for glycolysis to continue.\n\nIn Ghana's traditional **fufu** preparation, the physical pounding requires rapid muscle contractions that initially rely heavily on glycolysis for quick energy before the body can increase oxygen delivery for aerobic metabolism.",
