      "text": "The respiratory system consists of **conducting airways** that move air and **respiratory zones** where gas exchange occurs.\n\n**Conducting zone (air transport):**\n- **Nose/Mouth:** Filter, warm, and humidify air\n- **Pharynx:** Shared pathway for air and food\n- **Larynx:** Voice box with vocal cords\n- **Trachea:** Windpipe with cartilage rings\n- **Bronchi:** Primary branches to each lung\n- **Bronchioles:** Smaller branches within lungs\n\n**Respiratory zone (gas exchange):**\n- **Alveolar ducts:** Lead to alveoli\n- **Alveolar sacs:** Clusters of alveoli\n- **Alveoli:** Tiny air sacs (300 million per lung)\n\n**Lung structure:**\n- **Right lung:** 3 lobes\n- **Left lung:** 2 lobes (space for heart)\n- **Pleura:** Double membrane around lungs\n- **Pleural fluid:** Reduces friction during breathing\n\n**Respiratory muscles:**\n- **Diaphragm:** Primary muscle of inspiration\n- **Intercostal muscles:** Between ribs, assist breathing\n- **Accessory muscles:** Used during forced breathing\n\nIn Ghana's **dusty harmattan** season, the respiratory system's filtering mechanisms in the nose and airways work overtime to protect lungs from particles, highlighting the importance of proper respiratory anatomy for health.",

CO₂ diffuses from blood to alveoli for exhale\n\n**Factors affecting gas exchange:**\n- **Surface area:** More alveoli = better exchange\n- **Membrane thickness:** Thinner = faster diffusion\n- **Pressure gradients:** Greater difference = faster exchange\n- **Solubility:** CO₂ more soluble than O₂\n\nIn Ghana's urban areas like **Accra**, air pollution can damage alveolar surfaces and reduce gas exchange efficiency, contributing to respiratory diseases and highlighting the importance of clean air policies.",
