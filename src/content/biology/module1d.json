      "text": "The **cell cycle** is the ordered sequence of events leading to cell division and the production of two daughter cells. It consists of two main phases: **interphase** and **M phase** (mitosis and cytokinesis).\n\n**Interphase** includes three sub-phases:\n- **G1 phase** (Gap 1): Cell growth and normal metabolic activities\n- **S phase** (Synthesis): DNA replication occurs, duplicating chromosomes\n- **G2 phase** (Gap 2): Further growth and preparation for mitosis\n\n**M phase** includes:\n- **Mitosis**: Nuclear division creating two genetically identical nuclei\n- **Cytokinesis**: Division of the cytoplasm to create two separate cells\n\nSome cells exit the cycle and enter **G0**, a quiescent state where they perform specialized functions without dividing.\n\nIn Ghana's agricultural context, understanding the cell cycle explains how **yam** tubers grow larger through cell division, how wounds heal in farm animals, and why some plant tissues can regenerate when properly cared for.",

      "text": "**Mitosis** is the process of nuclear division that produces two genetically identical daughter nuclei. It consists of four main phases:\n\n**Prophase**: Chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting of two **sister chromatids** joined at the **centromere**. The nuclear envelope begins to break down, and the **spindle apparatus** starts forming from **centrosomes**.\n\n**Metaphase**: Chromosomes align at the cell's equator (the **metaphase plate**). Each chromosome is attached to spindle fibers from both poles, ensuring proper distribution.\n\n**Anaphase**: Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, pulled by shortening spindle fibers. This ensures each daughter cell receives identical genetic material.\n\n**Telophase**: Nuclear envelopes reform around each set of chromosomes, which begin to decondense. The spindle apparatus disassembles.\n\n**Cytokinesis** (division of cytoplasm) usually overlaps with telophase. In animal cells, a **contractile ring** pinches the cell in two. In plant cells, a **cell plate** forms to separate the daughter cells.\n\nThis process is crucial for growth in Ghanaian crops like **cassava** and **maize**, allowing plants to increase their size and produce more food.",

      "text": "The cell cycle is tightly regulated by **checkpoints** that ensure proper cell division. These checkpoints monitor:\n\n**G1/S checkpoint**: Checks for adequate cell size, nutrients, growth factors, and DNA damage before allowing DNA replication.\n\n**G2/M checkpoint**: Ensures DNA has been properly replicated and checks for DNA damage before allowing mitosis.\n\n**Spindle checkpoint**: Confirms all chromosomes are properly attached to spindle fibers before allowing anaphase to proceed.\n\nWhen checkpoints detect problems, they can halt the cell cycle to allow for repairs or trigger **apoptosis** (programmed cell death) if damage is too severe.\n\n**Cancer** occurs when these control mechanisms fail, leading to uncontrolled cell division. Cancer cells ignore normal growth signals and checkpoints, forming **tumors** that can spread to other parts of the body.\n\nIn Ghana, understanding cancer biology is important for public health. Risk factors include exposure to certain chemicals, viral infections, and lifestyle factors. Early detection and treatment improve outcomes, highlighting the importance of regular health screenings.",
