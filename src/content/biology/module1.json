      "text": "The cell membrane is a thin, flexible boundary that surrounds the cell. It is made of a **phospholipid bilayer** with embedded **proteins**, **cholesterol**, and **carbohydrate** chains. This structure creates a **selectively permeable** barrier, allowing some substances to pass while restricting others. Small nonpolar molecules like oxygen diffuse easily, while ions and large polar molecules require **transport proteins**.\n\nCells move substances by **passive transport** (no energy) and **active transport** (uses **ATP**). Passive transport includes **diffusion**, **osmosis** (water through aquaporins), and **facilitated diffusion** (via channels/carriers). Active transport pumps substances against concentration gradients (e.g., the **sodium–potassium pump**). In bulk transport, **endocytosis** brings materials in, and **exocytosis** exports them.\n\nIn Ghanaian agriculture, cells in **cassava** and **cocoa** roots rely on osmosis to maintain **turgor pressure** for firmness. If soil becomes salty (e.g., coastal farms), water may leave root cells by osmosis, causing wilting. Understanding membrane transport helps explain food preservation with salt and sugar, which draw water out of microbial cells, slowing spoilage.",
