      "text": "The **nucleus** is the control center of eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a **nuclear envelope** - a double membrane with **nuclear pores** that regulate the movement of molecules between nucleus and cytoplasm.\n\nInside the nucleus, **chromatin** consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. During cell division, chromatin condenses into visible **chromosomes**. The **nucleolus** is a dense region where **ribosomal RNA (rRNA)** is synthesized and ribosome assembly begins.\n\nNuclear pores act as selective gates, allowing small molecules to pass freely while controlling the transport of larger molecules like mRNA and proteins. This regulation ensures that genetic information flows correctly from DNA to proteins.\n\nIn Ghana's medical research, understanding nuclear structure helps explain genetic conditions that affect families, such as sickle cell disease, which results from DNA changes in the nucleus.",

      "title": "Gene Expression Process",
      "text": "Gene expression is the process by which genetic information flows from DNA to proteins through two main steps: **transcription** and **translation**.\n\n**Transcription** occurs in the nucleus, where DNA is used as a template to create **messenger RNA (mRNA)**. The enzyme **RNA polymerase** reads the DNA code and builds a complementary RNA strand.\n\n**Translation** occurs in the cytoplasm at ribosomes, where mRNA is read in groups of three nucleotides called **codons**. Each codon specifies an amino acid, and **transfer RNA (tRNA)** brings the correct amino acids to build proteins.\n\nThis process allows different cell types to express different genes. For example, in a **cocoa** plant, leaf cells express genes for photosynthesis while root cells express genes for water absorption, even though both contain the same DNA.\n\nGenetic variations in Ghanaian populations, such as those affecting malaria resistance, result from differences in DNA sequences that alter gene expression patterns.",
