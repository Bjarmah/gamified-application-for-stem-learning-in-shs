      "introduction": "Chemical bonding is the foundation of chemistry - it explains how atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. In this module, we'll explore different types of bonds and understand how they determine the properties of substances we encounter daily in Ghana.",
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Ionic and Covalent Bonding",
          "content": "Atoms form bonds to achieve stability. Ionic bonds occur when electrons are transferred between atoms, creating charged ions that attract each other. This happens between metals and non-metals, like in table salt (NaCl). Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons, typically between non-metals. The number of shared electrons determines the bond strength and molecular properties."
        },
        {
          "title": "Lewis Structures and Bond Properties",
          "content": "Lewis structures show how valence electrons are arranged around atoms in molecules. Single bonds share one pair of electrons, double bonds share two pairs, and triple bonds share three pairs. Bond length decreases as bond order increases, while bond energy increases. Understanding these structures helps predict molecular behavior and reactivity."
        },
        {
          "title": "Molecular Geometry and Polarity",
          "content": "VSEPR theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) explains molecular shapes. Electron pairs around the central atom arrange themselves to minimize repulsion. This determines whether molecules are polar or nonpolar. Polar molecules have uneven electron distribution, while nonpolar molecules have even distribution. Polarity affects solubility, melting points, and chemical behavior."
        },
        {
          "title": "Intermolecular Forces",
          "content": "Forces between molecules determine physical properties like boiling points and solubility. Hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen bonds to highly electronegative atoms like oxygen or nitrogen. Van der Waals forces are weaker attractions between all molecules. These forces explain why some substances dissolve in water while others don't, and why alcohol evaporates faster than water."
