        {
          "title": "Atomic Radius Trends",
          "content": "Atomic radius decreases across a period due to increasing nuclear charge pulling electrons closer. Atomic radius increases down a group as new electron shells are added. These trends are explained by the balance between nuclear attraction and electron-electron repulsion."
        },
        {
          "title": "Ionization Energy",
          "content": "Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. It increases across a period due to stronger nuclear attraction and decreases down a group as electrons are farther from the nucleus. Noble gases have the highest ionization energies in their periods."
        },
        {
          "title": "Electronegativity",
          "content": "Electronegativity measures an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. It increases across a period and decreases down a group. Fluorine is the most electronegative element. Electronegativity differences determine bond types: ionic, polar covalent, or nonpolar covalent."
        },
        {
          "title": "Metallic Character",
          "content": "Metallic character decreases across a period and increases down a group. Metals tend to lose electrons and form positive ions, while nonmetals gain electrons to form negative ions. Metalloids have intermediate properties and are found along the 'staircase' in the periodic table."

        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains constant", "Varies unpredictably"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Atomic radius decreases across a period because increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer to the nucleus."
