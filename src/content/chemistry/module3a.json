          "title": "Arrhenius Theory",
          "content": "Svante Arrhenius defined acids as substances that produce H+ ions in aqueous solution and bases as substances that produce OH- ions. This theory explains many common acids (HCl, H2SO4) and bases (NaOH, Ca(OH)2) but is limited to aqueous solutions and doesn't explain all acid-base behavior."

          "title": "Brønsted-Lowry Theory",
          "content": "Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry defined acids as proton (H+) donors and bases as proton acceptors. This theory is broader than Arrhenius theory and explains acid-base reactions in non-aqueous systems. It introduces the concept of conjugate acid-base pairs, where every acid has a conjugate base and vice versa."

        {
          "title": "Lewis Theory",
          "content": "Gilbert Lewis defined acids as electron pair acceptors and bases as electron pair donors. This is the broadest definition and includes substances not covered by other theories. Lewis acids often have incomplete octets (like BF3) or can expand their octets (like AlCl3), while Lewis bases have lone pairs of electrons."

          "content": "Each theory has specific applications: Arrhenius for simple aqueous solutions, Brønsted-Lowry for proton transfer reactions and buffer systems, and Lewis for coordination compounds and organic reactions. Understanding when to apply each theory is crucial for predicting and explaining chemical behavior."
