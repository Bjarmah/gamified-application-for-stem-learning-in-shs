          "content": "s orbitals are spherical, p orbitals are dumbbell-shaped with three orientations (px, py, pz), d orbitals have more complex shapes with five orientations, and f orbitals have very complex shapes with seven orientations. Each orbital type has characteristic energy and spatial distribution."
