          "content": "Electrons occupy energy levels (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) around the nucleus. Each energy level contains sublevels: s, p, d, and f. The s sublevel holds 2 electrons, p holds 6, d holds 10, and f holds 14. The number of sublevels increases with energy level number."

          "content": "The Aufbau principle states that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy. The typical filling order is: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p. This can be remembered using the diagonal rule or electron configuration charts."
