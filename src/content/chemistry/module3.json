          "title": "Acid-Base Theories and Properties",
          "content": "The Arrhenius theory defines acids as substances that produce H+ ions in water, while bases produce OH- ions. The Br√∏nsted-Lowry theory expands this to include proton donors (acids) and proton acceptors (bases). The pH scale ranges from 0-14, with 7 being neutral, below 7 acidic, and above 7 basic. Strong acids and bases completely dissociate in water, while weak ones partially dissociate."

        {
          "title": "Neutralization and Salt Formation",
          "content": "When acids react with bases, they undergo neutralization reactions, producing water and a salt. The salt formed depends on the acid and base used. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacting with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) produces table salt (NaCl) and water. Different types of salts have various properties and uses, from food seasoning to industrial applications."

          "content": "Acids and bases are everywhere around us. Citrus fruits contain citric acid, while baking soda is a base. Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid for digestion, and blood must maintain a specific pH range. Understanding acid-base chemistry helps us make better choices about food, medicine, and environmental protection."
