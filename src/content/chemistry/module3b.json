          "title": "pH and pOH Scales",
          "content": "pH = -log[H+] and pOH = -log[OH⁻]. At 25°C, pH + pOH = 14. Solutions with pH < 7 are acidic, pH = 7 is neutral, and pH > 7 is basic. Each pH unit represents a 10-fold change in hydrogen ion concentration. The pH scale typically ranges from 0 to 14, though values outside this range are possible."

          "content": "Strong acids (HCl, HNO3, H2SO4) and strong bases (Group 1 hydroxides, some Group 2 hydroxides) ionize completely in solution. For strong acids: [H+] = [acid] × number of H+ per molecule. For strong bases: [OH⁻] = [base] × number of OH⁻ per formula unit. Use Kw = [H+][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25°C."

Use Kb (base dissociation constant) for weak bases: Kb = [BH+][OH⁻]/[B]. For conjugate pairs: Ka × Kb = Kw. Use ICE tables (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to solve equilibrium problems."

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]) helps calculate buffer pH. Buffer capacity depends on concentrations and the ratio of components."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
