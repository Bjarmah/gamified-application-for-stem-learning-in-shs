          "content": "Metallic bonding involves a 'sea of electrons' that are delocalized across metal cations. This electron sea explains metallic properties: electrical conductivity (mobile electrons), thermal conductivity (electron movement transfers energy), malleability and ductility (layers can slide without breaking bonds), and metallic luster (electrons reflect light)."

          "title": "Types of Intermolecular Forces",
          "content": "London dispersion forces occur in all molecules due to temporary dipoles from electron movement. They increase with molecular size and surface area. Dipole-dipole forces occur between polar molecules. Hydrogen bonding is a special dipole-dipole interaction when H is bonded to F, N, or O and interacts with lone pairs on another electronegative atom."

          "title": "Effects on Physical Properties",
          "content": "Intermolecular forces determine melting points, boiling points, viscosity, and solubility. Stronger intermolecular forces lead to higher melting and boiling points. 'Like dissolves like' principle: polar substances dissolve in polar solvents, nonpolar in nonpolar solvents. Viscosity increases with stronger intermolecular attractions."

          "content": "Phase transitions involve overcoming intermolecular forces without breaking covalent bonds. Sublimation, melting, and vaporization require energy to overcome attractive forces. The strength of intermolecular forces determines the energy required and the temperature at which phase changes occur."
