        {
          "title": "Salt Formation Reactions",
          "content": "Salts form through various reactions: acid + base → salt + water (neutralization), acid + metal → salt + hydrogen gas, acid + metal carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxide, and double displacement reactions. The salt's cation comes from the base (or metal) and the anion comes from the acid."

        {
          "title": "Types of Salts",
          "content": "Normal salts have complete neutralization (NaCl, CaSO4). Acid salts retain replaceable hydrogen (NaHSO4, NaHCO3). Basic salts contain hydroxyl groups (Mg(OH)Cl). Double salts contain two different cations or anions (KAl(SO4)2·12H2O - alum). Complex salts contain complex ions (K3[Fe(CN)6])."

        {
          "title": "Salt Hydrolysis and Solution pH",
          "content": "When salts dissolve in water, they can undergo hydrolysis, affecting solution pH. Salts of strong acid + strong base are neutral (pH = 7). Salts of weak acid + strong base are basic (pH > 7) due to anion hydrolysis. Salts of strong acid + weak base are acidic (pH < 7) due to cation hydrolysis. Salts of weak acid + weak base depend on relative Ka and Kb values."

          "title": "Properties and Applications",
          "content": "Salt properties include ionic bonding, crystal structure, electrical conductivity in solution, and various solubilities. Applications include food preservation (NaCl), fertilizers (NH4NO3, KCl), medicine (MgSO4 - Epsom salt), and industrial processes. Solubility rules help predict precipitation reactions and salt preparation methods."

        "explanation": "CH3COONa is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and strong base (NaOH), so the acetate ion hydrolyzes to produce OH⁻ ions."
