      "introduction": "Ionic bonding occurs when electrons are transferred from metal atoms to nonmetal atoms, creating charged ions that attract each other. This type of bonding forms ionic compounds with characteristic properties like high melting points and electrical conductivity when dissolved.",
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Formation of Ionic Bonds",
          "content": "Metals have low ionization energies and readily lose electrons to form positive cations. Nonmetals have high electron affinities and readily gain electrons to form negative anions. The electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions creates ionic bonds. The driving force is the formation of stable electron configurations, typically noble gas configurations."
        },
        {
          "title": "Lattice Energy and Crystal Structure",
          "content": "Lattice energy is the energy required to separate one mole of ionic solid into gaseous ions. Higher lattice energies result from smaller ions and higher charges. Ionic compounds form crystal lattices with repeating three-dimensional patterns that maximize attraction and minimize repulsion between ions."
        },
        {
          "title": "Properties of Ionic Compounds",
          "content": "Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces. They conduct electricity when molten or dissolved because ions are mobile. Most are soluble in polar solvents like water but insoluble in nonpolar solvents. They are brittle because shifting layers brings like charges together, causing repulsion."
        },
        {
          "title": "Predicting Ionic Compound Formation",
          "content": "Ionic compounds form when the difference in electronegativity between elements is greater than 1.7. Metals from groups 1 and 2 readily form cations, while nonmetals from groups 16 and 17 readily form anions. The formula of ionic compounds reflects the charges needed for electrical neutrality."
