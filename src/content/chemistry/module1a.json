          "title": "Historical Development of Atomic Theory",
          "content": "The concept of atoms dates back to ancient Greek philosophers like Democritus, who proposed that matter consists of indivisible particles called 'atomos'. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formalized atomic theory with his postulates: all matter consists of atoms, atoms of the same element are identical, atoms cannot be created or destroyed in chemical reactions, and compounds form when atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios."

          "title": "Thomson's Atomic Model (Plum Pudding Model)",
          "content": "J.J. Thomson discovered the electron in 1897 through cathode ray experiments. His 'plum pudding' model proposed that atoms consist of a positively charged sphere with negatively charged electrons embedded within it, like raisins in a pudding. This model explained electrical neutrality but had limitations."

        {
          "title": "Rutherford's Nuclear Model",
          "content": "Ernest Rutherford's gold foil experiment in 1909 revolutionized atomic understanding. By bombarding thin gold foil with alpha particles, he discovered that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at the center, with electrons orbiting around it. Most of the atom is empty space."
        },
        {
          "title": "Bohr's Atomic Model",
          "content": "Niels Bohr refined Rutherford's model by proposing that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. Electrons can jump between these levels by absorbing or emitting energy. This model explained the discrete lines in atomic spectra and introduced the concept of quantized energy levels."
