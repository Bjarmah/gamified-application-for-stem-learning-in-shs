      "introduction": "Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons to achieve stable electron configurations. This sharing creates molecules with specific geometries and properties that differ significantly from ionic compounds.",

        {
          "title": "Formation of Covalent Bonds",
          "content": "Covalent bonds form when nonmetal atoms share electrons. The shared electrons are attracted to both nuclei, creating a bonding molecular orbital. Single bonds involve one shared pair, double bonds involve two pairs, and triple bonds involve three pairs. Bond strength increases with the number of shared electron pairs."

          "title": "Lewis Structures and Formal Charge",
          "content": "Lewis structures show bonding and nonbonding electrons in molecules. The octet rule states that atoms tend to form bonds until surrounded by eight valence electrons. Formal charge helps determine the best Lewis structure by minimizing charges and placing negative charges on the most electronegative atoms."

          "title": "VSEPR Theory and Molecular Geometry",
          "content": "Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory predicts molecular shapes based on electron pair repulsion. Electron pairs arrange themselves to minimize repulsion, creating specific geometries: linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral. Lone pairs occupy more space than bonding pairs."

          "title": "Polarity and Intermolecular Forces",
          "content": "Molecular polarity depends on bond polarity and molecular geometry. Polar molecules have dipole moments and experience stronger intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces include London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding. These forces determine physical properties like boiling point and solubility."
