      "text": "**Waves** are disturbances that transfer energy without transferring matter. **Transverse waves** have oscillations perpendicular to wave direction (like water waves), while **longitudinal waves** have oscillations parallel to direction (like sound waves).\n\nKey wave properties include **wavelength** (λ, distance between consecutive crests), **frequency** (f, oscillations per second), **amplitude** (A, maximum displacement), and **period** (T, time for one complete oscillation). The **wave equation** relates these: v = fλ, where v is wave speed.\n\nIn Ghana, understanding wave properties helps explain **radio transmission** across the country. Different frequencies allow multiple stations to broadcast simultaneously without interference, and understanding wavelength helps design efficient antenna systems.",
