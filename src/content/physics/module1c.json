      "introduction": "Energy is the capacity to do work, and work is done when a force causes displacement. These concepts are fundamental to understanding all physical processes, from the operation of machines to the motion of celestial bodies. The law of energy conservation tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.",
