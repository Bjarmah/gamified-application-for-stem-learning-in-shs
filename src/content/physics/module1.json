      "text": "**Kinematics** describes motion without considering forces. **Displacement** is the change in position (vector), while **distance** is the total path length (scalar). **Velocity** is displacement per unit time, and **acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. The four key equations of motion are: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², v² = u² + 2as, and s = ½(u + v)t, where u = initial velocity, v = final velocity, a = acceleration, s = displacement, and t = time.\n\nGraphs help visualize motion: displacement-time graphs show position changes, velocity-time graphs reveal acceleration (slope), and acceleration-time graphs show force changes. In Ghana, understanding stopping distance is crucial for **tro-tro safety**—a vehicle traveling at 60 km/h needs about 36 meters to stop on dry roads, considering reaction time and braking distance.",

Common forces include **weight** (mg, always downward), **normal force** (perpendicular to surface), **friction** (parallel to surface, opposing motion), and **tension** (pulling force in ropes/cables).\n\nIn Ghana, understanding these laws explains why **seatbelts save lives**—without them, passengers continue moving forward when a car suddenly stops, potentially hitting the windshield or dashboard.",
