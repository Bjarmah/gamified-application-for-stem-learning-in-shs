Later, Julius von Sachs showed that glucose is produced during photosynthesis.\n\nEconomic Importance in Ghana:\n- Cocoa production (major export crop)\n- Maize and cassava farming (staple foods)\n- Timber and forest products\n- Medicinal plant cultivation",

                "content": "Energy flows through ecosystems following fundamental laws of thermodynamics and ecological principles.\n\nEnergy Laws and Principles:\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics:\n- Energy cannot be created or destroyed\n- Energy can only be transformed from one form to another\n- Total energy in the universe remains constant\n\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics:\n- Energy transformations are never 100% efficient\n- Some energy is always lost as heat\n- Entropy (disorder) increases in isolated systems\n\nEnergy Flow Through Food Chains:\nTrophic Levels:\n1. Producers (Autotrophs): Plants, algae, cyanobacteria\n- Convert solar energy to chemical energy\n- Efficiency: ~1-3% of incident sunlight\n- Examples: Cocoa trees, maize, cassava\n\n2. Primary Consumers (Herbivores): Animals that eat plants\n- Efficiency: ~10% of plant energy\n- Examples: Goats, cattle, grasshoppers\n\n3. Secondary Consumers (Carnivores): Animals that eat herbivores\n- Efficiency: ~10% of herbivore energy\n- Examples: Lions, hawks, snakes\n\n4. Tertiary Consumers: Top predators\n- Efficiency: ~10% of secondary consumer energy\n- Examples: Eagles, crocodiles\n\nEnergy Loss at Each Level:\nWhy only ~10% efficiency?\n- Respiration: 60-70% lost as heat\n- Excretion: 10-20% lost in waste\n- Movement: 5-15% used for locomotion\n- Growth: 10-20% stored in biomass\n\nGhanaian Ecosystem Examples:\nForest Ecosystems - Kakum National Park:\n- Producers: Mahogany, teak, bamboo\n- Primary consumers: Forest elephants, duikers\n- Secondary consumers: Leopards, eagles\n- Decomposers: Fungi, bacteria, termites\n\nEnergy Flow:\n- Sunlight → Trees (photosynthesis)\n- Trees → Elephants (herbivory)\n- Elephants → Leopards (predation)\n- All levels → Decomposers (decay)\n\nAgricultural Ecosystems - Cocoa Farms:\n- Producers: Cocoa trees, shade trees\n- Primary consumers: Insects, rodents\n- Secondary consumers: Birds, lizards\n- Human intervention: Harvesting, pest control\n\nEnergy Efficiency Improvements:\n- Intercropping: Multiple crops increase total productivity\n- Agroforestry: Trees provide shade and nutrients\n- Integrated pest management: Reduces energy loss to pests\n\nMarine Ecosystems - Gulf of Guinea:\n- Producers: Phytoplankton, seaweeds\n- Primary consumers: Zooplankton, small fish\n- Secondary consumers: Larger fish, squid\n- Top predators: Sharks, tuna\n\nHuman Impact on Energy Flow:\nDeforestation:\n- Reduces producer biomass\n- Decreases total energy capture\n- Affects all trophic levels\n- Ghana example: Forest cover decreased from 35% to 10% in 50 years\n\nOverfishing:\n- Removes top predators\n- Disrupts food web balance\n- Can cause trophic cascades\n- Ghana example: Declining fish stocks in coastal waters\n\nPollution:\n- Toxic chemicals accumulate up food chains\n- Biomagnification: Higher concentrations in top predators\n- Ghana example: Mercury in fish from gold mining areas\n\nMathematical Modeling:\nEnergy Flow Equations:\nNet Primary Productivity (NPP): NPP = GPP - R\nWhere: GPP = Gross Primary Productivity, R = Respiration\n\nEcological Efficiency: Efficiency = (Energy at level n) / (Energy at level n-1) × 100%\n\nBiomass Pyramid:\n- Producers: 1000 kg/ha\n- Primary consumers: 100 kg/ha\n- Secondary consumers: 10 kg/ha\n- Tertiary consumers: 1 kg/ha\n\nCarbon Cycling:\n- Photosynthesis: CO₂ + H₂O → Glucose + O₂\n- Respiration: Glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + ATP\n- Net effect: Carbon cycles between atmosphere and biosphere\n\nClimate Change Implications:\nTemperature Effects:\n- Higher temperatures: Increase respiration rates\n- Net effect: More CO₂ released to atmosphere\n- Feedback loop: Warming → more CO₂ → more warming\n\nCO₂ Fertilization:\n- Higher CO₂: Can increase photosynthesis\n- Limiting factors: Water, nutrients, temperature\n- Ghana example: Some crops may benefit, others may not\n\nExtreme Weather:\n- Droughts: Reduce photosynthesis, increase respiration\n- Floods: Damage plants, reduce productivity\n- Storms: Physical damage to ecosystems\n\nConservation Strategies:\nProtected Areas:\n- National parks: Preserve natural energy flow\n- Marine reserves: Protect ocean ecosystems\n- Community forests: Sustainable resource use\n\nSustainable Agriculture:\n- Crop rotation: Maintain soil fertility\n- Organic farming: Reduce chemical inputs\n- Agroecology: Work with natural systems\n\nRestoration Ecology:\n- Reforestation: Restore producer biomass\n- Wetland restoration: Improve water quality\n- Coral reef restoration: Protect marine biodiversity",
