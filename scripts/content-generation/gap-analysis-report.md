## Content Quality Gaps

### Missing Elements
1. **Formative Assessments**: No quick progress checks
2. **Practice Exercises**: Limited guided practice
3. **Visual Aids**: No diagrams, charts, or interactive elements
4. **Key Terms**: No vocabulary definitions
5. **Prerequisites**: No clear learning path dependencies

### Ghana Context Gaps
1. **ICT**: No local examples or cultural connections
2. **Career Connections**: Limited information about Ghanaian job opportunities
3. **Real-world Applications**: Insufficient local industry examples

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### 🔴 Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Critical Fixes
- [ ] Restructure ICT modules to match standardized format
- [ ] Add 5-8 basic questions per lesson (all subjects)
- [ ] Implement missing question types (fill-in-blank, short answer)

### 🟡 Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Content Enhancement  
- [ ] Add 5-8 intermediate questions per lesson
- [ ] Include Ghana context examples
- [ ] Add formative assessments

### 🟢 Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Advanced Features
- [ ] Add 2-4 advanced questions per lesson
- [ ] Implement practice exercises
- [ ] Add visual aids and interactive elements

## Resource Requirements

### Content Creation
- **Total Questions Needed**: 364 additional questions
- **Estimated Time**: 40-60 hours
- **Subject Matter Experts**: 1 per subject (5 total)
- **Content Reviewers**: 2-3 for quality assurance

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Updates**: Question bank structure
- **Frontend Updates**: New question type components
- **Testing**: Question functionality and scoring

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Questions per Lesson**: 15-20 (currently 6.1)
- **Question Types**: 8-9 different types (currently 3-4)
- **Difficulty Balance**: 40/40/20 (currently 70/25/5)
- **Ghana Context**: 100% coverage (currently 80%)

### Quality Targets
- **WASSCE Alignment**: 95%+ compliance
- **Student Engagement**: 80%+ completion rate
- **Knowledge Retention**: 70%+ post-assessment scores

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review and approve standardized templates
2. **Week 1**: Begin ICT module restructuring
3. **Week 2**: Start question generation for all subjects
4. **Week 3**: Implement new question types in frontend
5. **Week 4**: Content review and quality assurance
6. **Week 5**: Testing and student feedback
7. **Week 6**: Final adjustments and deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
