# Module Completion System

## Overview
This system automatically marks modules as completed when users score 70% or higher on associated quizzes.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Module Completion
- **Threshold**: Modules are marked as completed when quiz scores reach 70% or higher
- **Database Update**: User progress is automatically updated in the `user_progress` table
- **Gamification Integration**: Module completion counts are updated in the gamification system

### 2. Quiz Context Enhancements
- **Module Tracking**: QuizContext now tracks the current module being tested
- **Completion Logic**: Centralized logic for marking modules as completed
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate completion entries

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when modules are completed
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates to completion status
- **Notifications**: Toast notifications for successful module completion

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- `quizzes.module_id` - Links quizzes to specific modules
- `user_progress.completed` - Boolean flag for module completion
- `user_progress.score` - Stores the quiz score that completed the module
- `user_gamification.modules_completed` - Count of completed modules

### Key Components

#### QuizContext (`src/context/QuizContext.tsx`)
- `markModuleCompleted()` - Marks a module as completed
- `isModuleCompleted()` - Checks if a module is already completed
- `currentModuleId` - Tracks the current module being tested

#### Quiz Component (`src/pages/Quiz.tsx`)
- Automatically triggers module completion on quiz submission
- Updates gamification data (XP, streaks, completion counts)
- Shows completion status in results

#### Gamification Hook (`src/hooks/use-gamification.tsx`)
- `updateModulesCompleted()` - Updates module completion count
- `updateQuizzesCompleted()` - Updates quiz completion count

### Flow
1. User takes a quiz
2. Quiz is submitted with score calculation
3. If score â‰¥ 70%:
   - Module is marked as completed in `user_progress`
   - Gamification data is updated
   - User receives completion notification
4. Progress is reflected in UI components

## Usage

### For Developers
```typescript
import { useQuizContext } from '@/context/QuizContext';

const { markModuleCompleted, isModuleCompleted } = useQuizContext();

// Check if module is completed
const completed = await isModuleCompleted(moduleId);

// Mark module as completed
await markModuleCompleted(moduleId, score, updateGamification);
```

### For Users
1. Navigate to a subject with modules
2. Take the quiz for a specific module
3. Score 70% or higher to automatically complete the module
4. See completion status reflected in progress tracking

## Configuration

### Passing Score Threshold
The 70% threshold is hardcoded in the Quiz component:
```typescript
if (scorePct >= 70 && quiz?.module_id) {
  // Mark module as completed
}
```

### Database Requirements
- `quizzes` table must have `module_id` field populated
- `user_progress` table must exist with proper constraints
- `user_gamification` table for tracking completion counts

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a quiz with questions
2. Ensure quiz has `module_id` set
3. Take quiz and score below 70%
4. Verify module is NOT marked as completed
5. Retake quiz and score 70% or higher
6. Verify module IS marked as completed
7. Check progress tracking updates

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check user progress
SELECT * FROM user_progress WHERE user_id = 'user_uuid' AND completed = true;

-- Check gamification data
SELECT modules_completed FROM user_gamification WHERE user_id = 'user_uuid';
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Allow different passing scores per module/subject
- **Partial Completion**: Track progress below 70% threshold
- **Retry Limits**: Limit number of quiz attempts
- **Achievement Unlocks**: Special rewards for high scores
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed completion statistics

### Integration Opportunities
- **Learning Paths**: Sequential module unlocking
- **Prerequisites**: Require module completion before advanced content
- **Certification**: Official completion certificates
- **Social Features**: Share completion achievements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Module not marked as completed**
   - Verify quiz has `module_id` set
   - Check user authentication
   - Verify database permissions

2. **Progress not updating**
   - Check gamification hook integration
   - Verify query invalidation
   - Check for JavaScript errors

3. **Duplicate completions**
   - `isModuleCompleted()` should prevent this
   - Check database constraints

### Debug Information
- Console logs show completion attempts
- Database queries are logged on errors
- Toast notifications confirm successful completion

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity
- Only authenticated users can complete modules
- Quiz scores are validated before completion
- Database constraints prevent invalid data

### User Privacy
- Completion data is user-specific
- No cross-user progress sharing
- Secure authentication required

## Performance Notes

### Optimization
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Gamification updates are batched where possible
- Progress queries use efficient joins

### Scalability
- System designed for multiple concurrent users
- Database operations are lightweight
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
