# TryHackMe-Style Learning Integration

This document describes the integration of TryHackMe-style learning rooms into the Ghana STEM Learning Platform.

## Overview

The platform now includes both traditional structured modules and interactive TryHackMe-style rooms, providing students with multiple learning approaches:

- **Structured Modules**: Traditional learning format with text, questions, and exercises
- **TryHackMe Rooms**: Interactive, gamified challenges with progressive tasks and achievements

## Features

### TryHackMe Rooms
- **Progressive Task System**: Complete tasks sequentially to unlock new content
- **Multiple Question Types**: Multiple choice, text input, and scenario-based questions
- **Hints System**: Access helpful hints for each task
- **Achievement System**: Earn badges and points for completing challenges
- **Ghanaian Context**: All content includes local examples and applications
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion status

### Search & Discovery
- **Unified Search**: Search across both modules and rooms
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by subject, difficulty, type, and tags
- **Content Preview**: Detailed information before starting learning
- **Related Content**: Discover related modules and rooms

## Available Rooms

### Chemistry
- **Atomic Structure & Electron Configuration** (Easy, 150 points)
  - 5 tasks covering atomic structure, electron configuration, and Ghanaian applications
  - Topics: Gold mining, cocoa farming, traditional medicine

### ICT/Computing

## Room Format

Each TryHackMe room follows this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "roomId": "unique-room-identifier",
  "roomName": "Human-readable room name",
  "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
  "category": "Subject name",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "description": "Room description",
  "estimatedTime": "2 hours",
  "points": 150,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "taskId": "task-1",
      "taskNumber": 1,
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "Task description",
      "questions": [...],
      "hints": ["hint1", "hint2"],
      "completionMessage": "Success message"
    }
  ],
  "achievements": [...],
  "ghanaContext": {
    "localExamples": [...],
    "culturalConnections": [...],
    "realWorldApplications": [...]
  }
}
```
