# Mock Data Removal - Real Data Migration

## Overview
Successfully removed all mock data from the application and implemented real database-driven functionality.

## Files Refactored

### ✅ ActivityFeed.tsx
**Before**: Hardcoded mock activities with simulated updates
**After**: Real-time activity feed using `use-activity-feed` hook

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ Removed 69 lines of mock activity data
- ❌ Removed fake interval-based activity simulation
- ✅ Added real-time database queries for:
  - Module completions (`user_progress`)
  - Quiz attempts (`quiz_attempts`, `room_quiz_attempts`)
  - Achievement earnings (`user_achievements`)
  - Room joins (`room_members`)
- ✅ Added proper loading states with skeletons
- ✅ Added empty state handling
- ✅ Added real-time subscriptions for live updates

### ✅ NotificationContext.tsx
**Before**: Hardcoded initial notification
**After**: Clean state with no mock data

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ Removed hardcoded streak reminder notification
- ✅ Now starts with empty notifications array
- ✅ Relies on real notifications from Supabase

### ✅ use-activity-feed.tsx (New Hook)
**Created**: Comprehensive real-time activity feed system

**Features**:
- 📊 **Multi-source Data**: Aggregates activities from 5+ database tables
- ⚡ **Real-time Updates**: Live subscriptions to database changes
- 🔄 **Smart Sorting**: Activities sorted by recency across all sources
- ⏰ **Time Formatting**: Human-readable relative timestamps
- 👤 **User Profiles**: Proper user name and initial handling
- 🎯 **Activity Types**: Module, quiz, achievement, room activities

## Database Tables Used

| Table | Purpose | Activity Type |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `user_progress` | Module completions | `module` |
| `quiz_attempts` | Quiz completions | `quiz` |
| `room_quiz_attempts` | Room quiz completions | `quiz` |
| `user_achievements` | Achievement unlocks | `achievement` |
| `room_members` | Room joins | `room_join` |

## Real-time Subscriptions

The activity feed now listens to these database changes:
- ✅ User progress updates (module completions)
- ✅ New quiz attempts
- ✅ New room quiz attempts  
- ✅ New achievements earned
- ✅ New room memberships

## Data Flow

```
Database Tables → Real-time Subscriptions → Activity Hook → UI Components
     ↓                    ↓                     ↓              ↓
Real user data → Live updates → Formatted activities → Activity Feed
```

## Analytics & Gamification Status

✅ **Already Using Real Data**:
- Analytics Dashboard (`use-analytics.tsx`)
- Gamification Dashboard (`use-gamification.tsx`) 
- Leaderboards (`use-leaderboard.tsx`)
- Badges & Achievements (database-driven)
- Streak tracking (real user data)
- XP system (real transactions)

## Performance Optimizations

- **Connection Pooling**: Activity subscriptions managed by realtime manager
- **Efficient Queries**: Limited to recent activities only
- **Smart Updates**: Only refetches when relevant changes occur
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all data structures

## Migration Results

| Component | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| ActivityFeed | 69 lines mock data | Real DB queries | ✅ Complete |
| NotificationContext | 1 hardcoded notification | Clean state | ✅ Complete |
| Analytics | Real data | Real data | ✅ Already real |
| Gamification | Real data | Real data | ✅ Already real |
| Badges | Real data | Real data | ✅ Already real |
| Achievements | Real data | Real data | ✅ Already real |

## Testing Checklist
